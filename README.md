# Car-Parking-System
Design a simple car parking sensor system that helps drivers detect obstacles and avoid collisions while parking. The system measures the distance between the car and an obstacle using an ultrasonic sensor and displays the distance on an LCD screen. LEDs and a buzzer provide visual and auditory warnings based on the proximity of the object.
